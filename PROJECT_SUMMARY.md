# Student Course Registration System - Project Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview

This is a complete Java-based student course registration system that demonstrates modern software development practices. The system allows students to register for courses, manage their schedules, and provides administrators with course management capabilities.

## ✅ What's Been Built

### Core Features Implemented
- **Student Management System**
  - Student registration with secure password hashing (BCrypt)
  - User authentication and session management
  - Profile management and viewing
  - Duplicate prevention (username/email validation)

- **Course Management System**
  - Course creation and management
  - Course catalog browsing
  - Advanced search functionality (by name, code, instructor, department)
  - Capacity management and availability tracking

- **Registration System**
  - Course enrollment with validation
  - Schedule conflict detection
  - Capacity limit enforcement
  - Course dropping functionality
  - Registration history tracking

- **Console User Interface**
  - Interactive menu system
  - User-friendly navigation
  - Input validation and error handling
  - Sample data initialization

### Technical Implementation

#### Architecture
- **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** pattern
- **Repository Pattern** for data access abstraction
- **Service Layer Pattern** for business logic encapsulation
- **Dependency Injection** through constructor injection

#### Technology Stack
- **Java 17** - Modern Java features and performance
- **Maven** - Build automation and dependency management
- **JUnit 5** - Comprehensive unit testing
- **BCrypt** - Secure password hashing
- **AWS DynamoDB SDK** - Cloud database integration (with in-memory fallback)

#### Data Models
```java
Student {
    studentId, firstName, lastName, email, username, 
    passwordHash, major, year, gpa, phone, address,
    createdAt, updatedAt
}

Course {
    courseId, courseCode, courseName, description, credits,
    department, instructor, semester, year, schedule,
    location, capacity, enrolled, prerequisites,
    createdAt, updatedAt
}

Registration {
    registrationId, studentId, courseId, status,
    grade, registeredAt, droppedAt
}
```

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Java 17 or higher
- Maven 3.6 or higher

### Quick Start
```bash
# Clone/navigate to project directory
cd student-course-registration-app

# Build the project
mvn clean package

# Run the application
java -jar target/student-course-registration-app-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar

# Or use the provided scripts
./run.sh        # Linux/Mac
run.bat         # Windows
```

### Sample Login
- **Username**: `hemant`
- **Password**: `password123`

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive unit tests covering:
- Student creation and authentication
- Course management operations
- Registration validation and business rules
- Duplicate prevention mechanisms
- Search functionality

```bash
# Run all tests
mvn test

# View test results
# Tests run: 7, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0
```

## 🔧 Configuration Options

### Database Modes

#### In-Memory Mode (Default)
- Perfect for development and testing
- No external dependencies
- Data persists only during application runtime
- Used by `Simple*Service` classes

#### DynamoDB Mode
- Production-ready cloud database
- Requires AWS credentials configuration
- Persistent data storage
- Used by `*Service` classes (without "Simple" prefix)

### Switching Between Modes
In `App.java`, change the service implementations:
```java
// In-memory mode (current)
private static final SimpleStudentService studentService = new SimpleStudentService();

// DynamoDB mode
private static final StudentService studentService = new StudentService();
```
